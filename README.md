# Module_4_Challenge

We are evaluating four investment options in the S&P 500 using the risk management metrics. 
First thing first, we import all the needed libaries like pandas, numpy, path from and %matplotlib inline for plotting
Imported data by reading csv file into pandas dataframe. 
Then we analyzed the performance by calculating the daily returns and cumulative returns for the four portfolios and the S&P 500. Plotted it
Analyzed the volatility by box plotting each fund and sp500
Analyzed the risk by calculating the standard deviation and beta. 
Analyzed the risk-return profile by calculating the sharpe ratios and visualizing it. 
Chose 2 portfolios and used the 60 day rolling window, daily return data, sp500 returns, and calculated the covariance. 
Plotted each portfolio at the end for visual analysis to choose the best return.
